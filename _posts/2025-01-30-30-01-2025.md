Yo lets see if the date works now

Ok now we're going to deploy from the raspberry pi

Cool so I think from now i should be able to use this flask app i created to take notes and when I save in the flask app it will create a jekyll markdown file and a nightly cron job will do a git commit for me and push the post up to github. Makes it a lot easier to blog when you can easily do it from your phone laying it bed at night and don't have to fire up the computer and open a text editor and create a new markdown file and name it properly and create the date etc... anyway let's have some fun with this and see where we go.
